# Implementation Overview

The Genetic Algorithm's workflow in the code can be summarised in the following steps:

1. **Initialize the Population**: We start by generating a random population of chromosomes. For our purposes, this could be random strings of bits if we're using binary encoding.

2. **Evaluate Fitness**: Each individual in the population is evaluated based on the fitness function.

3. **Select Parents**: Parents are selected based on their fitness scores. Individuals with higher fitness have a higher chance of being chosen to reproduce.

4. **Generate Offspring Through Crossover**: Selected parents produce offspring through crossover, combining parts of each parent's chromosome.

5. **Apply Mutation**: Offspring undergo mutations, with a small probability of altering one or more genes.

6. **Repeat**: The process repeats for several generations until a satisfactory solution is found.
