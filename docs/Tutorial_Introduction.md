# Genetic Algorithm Tutorial

Welcome to this Genetic Algorithm (GA) tutorial. In this tutorial, we will explore how GAs work and how they can be implemented to solve optimisation problems effectively. We'll break down the code I've uploaded and explain each part so you can understand how to implement and improve upon this GA for your projects.

Here are a few reasons why you might still want to write your own GA code:

- Customization: Writing your own GA code gives you full control over the implementation. You can customize the GA operators, fitness functions, and parameters to suit the specific problem you're trying to solve.
- Integration with Existing Code: If you have existing code or systems that need to interact with the GA, integrating a custom implementation may be easier than adapting pre-existing libraries to fit your needs.
- Performance Optimization: Depending on your specific requirements, you may find that a custom implementation of the GA performs better or is more efficient than using a general-purpose library.

## What is a Genetic Algorithm?

A Genetic Algorithm is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. It is particularly suited to solving optimization problems by mimicking processes such as mutation, crossover, and selection.
