# Conclusion

This tutorial walked through the implementation of a basic Genetic Algorithm using Python. GAs are powerful tools for solving complex optimisation problems. They simulate natural selection, where only the fittest solutions survive and evolve. Through selection, crossover, and mutation processes, GAs can efficiently explore and exploit the search space to find near-optimal solutions.

Feel free to experiment with the code, adjust parameters like the mutation and crossover rates, and apply the GA to different optimisation problems to see how it performs.
