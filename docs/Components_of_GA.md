# Components of a Genetic Algorithm

## Population

The population in a GA consists of several individuals, each representing a potential solution to the problem at hand. Each individual is coded as a chromosome.

## Chromosome Representation

In our implementation, chromosomes are represented as arrays or data strings (genes). The structure of a chromosome depends on the problem being solved. In binary encoding, each gene is a binary digit.

## Fitness Function

The fitness function evaluates how good a solution is. It quantitatively expresses an individual's suitability in the population, allowing the GA to guide the evolution towards optimal solutions.

## Selection

Selection is the process by which individuals are chosen from the population for reproduction. The goal is to preferentially select the better solutions, allowing them to pass on their genes to the next generation.

## Crossover (Recombination)

Crossover is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to produce new offspring. It mimics biological reproduction, where offspring receives DNA from two parents.

## Mutation

Mutation introduces random changes in the offspringâ€™s chromosomes, helping to maintain diversity within the population. This introduces new traits into the population, which is crucial for avoiding local optima.
